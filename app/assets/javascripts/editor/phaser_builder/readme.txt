Like the js_builder directory, this directory contains classes that will eventually yield pure JavaScript code as output.

The difference is that the JS classes represent JavaScript syntax in general, while the PH classes here represent a subset of JavaScript: the syntax, functions, variables, etc specific to a Phaser game.
